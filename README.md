# OWASP Security Shepherd Vagrant Container
The <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Security_Shepherd">OWASP Security Shepherd</a> project is a web and mobile application security training platform. Security Shepherd has been designed to foster and improve security awareness among a varied skill-set demographic. The aim of this project is to take AppSec novices or experienced engineers and sharpen their penetration testing skillset to security expert status.

### What is this?
This helps you build Security Shepherd into a Vagrant container rather than using the large ova file. It assumes you already have vagrant installed, if not grab it from https://www.vagrantup.com/ before you begin.

### Some assumptions:
1: You wish to connect to the container, via localhost on port 8080
2: You wish to use the standard Tomcat port of 8080 in the container
3: You are using the default MySQL password of CowSaysMoo for the database

If the above is correct, then you are golden.

### Support
For all issues with the scripts here, drop me a mail. Daniel AT OWASP.org. For any issues with Security Shepherd, I'd recommend you drop both Mark and Sean an email. Their details can be found on the main <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Security_Shepherd">site</a>
